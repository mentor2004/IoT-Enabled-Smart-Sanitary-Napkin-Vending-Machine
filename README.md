This repository contains the complete work of the project “IoT-Enabled Smart Sanitary Napkin Vending Machine”, including hardware design, software modules, mobile dashboard, cloud integration, and reports and papers.

🔹 Abstract

This project proposes a smart sanitary napkin vending machine with UPI-based cashless payment, real-time stock monitoring, and IoT-enabled remote administration.
Using a microcontroller (ESP32/Raspberry Pi), stepper motor, sensors, and a cloud database (Firebase/AWS IoT), the system ensures secure vending, automated alerts, and seamless user interaction.

🔹 Key Features

✔ UPI-based QR code payment

✔ Automated dispensing using stepper/servo motor

✔ Real-time stock detection with IR/Ultrasonic/Load-cell sensors

✔ Cloud monitoring (Firebase / AWS / Azure)

✔ Remote dashboard for admin

✔ Mobile app / Web app for monitoring

✔ Low-stock alerts & predictive restocking

✔ Secure transactions with encryption
